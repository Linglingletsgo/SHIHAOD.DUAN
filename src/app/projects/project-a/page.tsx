      description="As desires increase, technology can bring healing, evolution, and sometimes loss of control. Buddhism promotes reducing desires for balance. Psychedelics can lead to both healing and loss of control. Buddhist meditation trains the brain and, like psychedelics, changes brain activity to offer new experiences. While meditation is a slow, long-term practice, psychedelics act quickly. This project proposes using wearable devices that apply the principles of both meditation and psychedelics to rapidly and controllably alter brain activity, enhancing self-control and happiness."
